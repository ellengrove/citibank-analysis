# Average Number of Rides per Hour
**Figure 1** shows the average number of rides taken each hour. Most Citi Bike usage is concentrated between the hours of 7am and 9am and between the hours of 5pm and 7pm, aligned with rush hour. This demonstrates that many users of Citi Bike use the service as part of their daily commute.

# Percentage of Rides per Hour by Rider Type

Citi Bike members (as opposed to riders without a membership) account for a majority of the rides taken throughout the week when evaluated on a daily and hourly basis. However, the proportion of rides taken by casual riders increases between the hours of 12am and 3am on both weeknights and weekend nights. Taken in conjunction with **Figure 1**, riders with Citi Bike memberships are more likely to use Citi Bike for their daily commutes compared with casual riders, whereas casual riders (for example, tourists) are more likely to use the bike service at unusual hours (such a late at night returning from restaurants or bars).

# Percentage of Rides by Type of Bike

Over the course of the week, Citi Bike casual riders were more inclined than subscribers to use electric bikes over classic bikes (48% of casual rides versus 38% of member rides). Casual riders are perhaps more likely to be "experience" riders--i.e. given the option between a classic bike and an electric bike, they may opt for the more interesting experience. On the other hand, for Citi Bike members are likely to be more habit riders who are less concerned with the experience of a ride on an electric bike and more so interested in getting from point a to point b.
