# Citi Bike Consumer Trends - April 3 - April 9, 2022

This analysis undertakes to illuminate trends specifically relating to two classes of Citi Bike users - subscribers and casual riders - and comparing ridership on weekends versus weekdays. Such insights can be leveraged to inform decisions about how to market Citi Bike to different types of riders, where to install more docking stations, and how to collaborate with city officials to ensure that New York City residents can enjoy safe and easy bike travel while promoting an environmentally friendly means of transportation. 

## Average Number of Rides per Hour
**Figure 1** shows the average number of rides taken each hour. Most Citi Bike usage is concentrated between the hours of 7am and 9am and between the hours of 5pm and 7pm, during standard rush hours. This demonstrates that many users of Citi Bike use the service as part of their daily commute.

Furthermore, weekdays see a much higher percentage of rides taken by subscribers than by casual riders. Intuitively, this percentage drops somewhat on weekends (when, for example, there are more tourists using Citi Bike), although subscribers still carry the majority of the rides on weekends. 

## Percentage of Rides per Hour by Rider Type

While Citi Bike members (as opposed to riders without a membership) account for a majority of the rides taken throughout the week when evaluated on a daily and hourly basis, the proportion of rides taken by casual riders increases between the hours of 12am and 3am on both weeknights and weekend nights. Taken in conjunction with **Figure 1**, riders with Citi Bike memberships are more likely to use Citi Bike for their daily commutes compared with casual riders, whereas casual riders are more likely to use the bike service at unusual hours (such a late at night returning from restaurants or bars).

## Percentage of Rides by Type of Bike

Over the course of the week, Citi Bike casual riders were more inclined than subscribers to use electric bikes over classic bikes (48% of casual rides versus 38% of member rides). Casual riders are perhaps more likely to be "experience" riders--i.e. given the option between a classic bike and an electric bike, they may opt for the more interesting experience. On the other hand, for Citi Bike members are likely to be more habit riders who are less concerned with the experience of a ride on an electric bike and more so interested in getting from point a to point b.This is further evidenced by the fact that the average bike ride duration for Citi Bike subscribers was 11.7 minutes versus 17.6 minutes for casual riders. Casual riders use Citi Bike for slightly longer distances and they are in less of a rush to get there.

## Conclusions

While further analysis is necessary to track these trends over wider time periods and to get a firmer understanding of the user base of Citi Bike, the above obvservations could be used in a multitude of ways to improve the consumer experience at Citi Bike and maximize returns for stakeholders. For example, concentrating electric bike stations near hot tourist attractions or popular restaurant districts may capture more ridership from casual riders. Ad compaigns could encourage New Yorkers to use Citi Bike as a fast and reliable alternative to public transportation or driving. Citi Bike further may consider special subscriptions for commuters or work with the city and state to offer tax incentives to workers who subscribe to monthly passes through their employers.
